"s." en comments "Signs and symbols fuel the power of the mind to reflect, understand, form judgments and generate further symbols. By combining signs, you obtain deduction, induction, interpretation and imagination. The idealist traditions that include Plato, Plotinus or Berkeley, as well as a large part of the major meditational philosophies, are all based primarily on the act of reflection."
